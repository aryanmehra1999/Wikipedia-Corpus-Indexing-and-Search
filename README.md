# Wikipedia-Corpus-Indexing-and-Search
This repository contains the work done for the indexing of and search over Wikipedia corpus. The search consists of multi-word queries and adds on three heuristics to show their effectiveness over the queries where the original scoring and search fails. 

Read the report titled "Information Retrieval - Report (Document Ranking and Search)" for the detailed explanation of each and every aspect of the project work.
